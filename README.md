# HPDS Quarto Poster Format

## Installing

```bash
quarto use template StanfordHPDS/hpds-poster
```

This will install the format extension and create an example `qmd` file
that you can use as a starting place for your document.

See the example `.qmd` file for usage details and <https://github.com/StanfordHPDS/hpds-poster-example> (internal to HPDS) for an extended example.
